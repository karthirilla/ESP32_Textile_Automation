# ESP32 Textile Automation

## Overview

The **ESP32 Textile Automation** project is designed to provide an IoT solution for textile machines using the **ESP32-S3** microcontroller. The project automates monitoring of the textile machine's operational status, such as whether the machine is running or idle, by measuring its **machine angle** and **movement**. The project is developed with industrial IoT requirements in mind, offering real-time monitoring, firmware updates, and system configuration.

Since this is part of a proprietary company project, many hardware designs, sensor data, and detailed implementations are confidential. The system is designed to be scalable, cost-effective, and robust for large-scale industrial applications in the textile sector.

2. **Sensors**: Used to monitor the machine's **angle** and **movement** for determining its operational status.
3. **PCB Design**: Custom-designed PCB that houses the ESP32-S3 and other components, including power management, sensors, and communication interfaces.
4. **External Hardware Integration**: The system is designed to support numerous external connections for additional sensors or actuators.
5. **Power Supply**: Ensures stable power for ESP32-S3 and connected peripherals.
6. **Communication Protocols**: Utilizes MQTT and FTP for secure and efficient data transfer over the network.
7. **Remote Configuration & Firmware Updates**: Enables remote management of the system, including OTA firmware updates and system configuration via cloud or local server.

## Features in Detail

### 1. **ESP32-S3 for IoT**
The **ESP32-S3** provides a high-performance platform for industrial automation, featuring:
- Dual-core processing power.
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.
- Support for external hardware connections, making it suitable for industrial-grade IoT applications.

### 2. **Machine Status Monitoring**
The ESP32-S3 communicates with sensors to determine the status of the textile machine:
- **Machine Angle**: Measures the angle of the machine to track its position.
- **Machine Movement**: Detects whether the machine is running or idle.

This information is processed and transmitted to a central system to monitor machine activity in real-time.

### 3. **Remote System Configuration**
The system allows remote configuration, making it easy to:
- Adjust machine settings.
- Monitor operational status.
- Diagnose issues remotely.

Configuration is done via an **IoT cloud service** or **local server**, ensuring that no physical intervention is required.

### 4. **OTA Firmware Updates**
One of the key features of this project is the ability to update the firmware remotely. The **ESP32-S3** supports **OTA (Over-The-Air) updates**, allowing the firmware to be updated without needing to access the device physically. This is particularly useful for large-scale deployments where frequent updates may be necessary.

### 5. **Offline Data Storage**
The system is capable of storing sensor data locally if the network is unavailable. This ensures that no data is lost during network outages. Once the connection is restored, the system uploads the stored data to the central server.

### 6. **Communication with IoT Protocols**
The system supports **MQTT** for real-time communication between the devices and the central system, ensuring that machine status is continuously updated and available remotely. **FTP** is used for transferring files and logs from the machine to the server, providing additional flexibility for system integration.
